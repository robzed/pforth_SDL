# PForth SDL - pForth extended with libSDL bindings

This is a work in progress - currently under construction.

Originally this was meant to be a set of instructions inside a different project
but as the changes grew, it seemed like having a fork of pforth was the best idea
for everyone, including me. However, although this is a fork, it intends to stay 
as close to pForth base as I can - and hopefully some of the non-SDL changes can 
be migrated back to pForth.

It's based on the following projects:

* pForth  
    * https://www.softsynth.com/pforth
    * https://github.com/philburk/pforth
    * 0BSD License
* ProgrammingRainbow's SDL binding for gForth:
    * https://github.com/ProgrammingRainbow/Beginners-Guide-to-SDL2-in-Gforth
    * Zlib License
    * (also see the videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZFMcBKKiCM)
* libSDL
    * https://www.libsdl.org
    * Zlib License

Current lot of things are under construction. Right now it works for me on MacOS 
with the SDL framework installed in Library/Framework - but mainly I want to fix the 
cross-platform stuff and add static linking with SDL in so that people an play 
your game without extra DLLs, shared libs, or frameworks. Oh, I really want to get
back to programming my game (which isn't even for pForth or SDL) ... this is a 
purely a side quest :-D

This project is licensed mostly in 0BSD, with the SDL specific parts being Zlib.

Instructions - see the three projects above. NOTE: There are a few minor
differences between gForth and pForth, so you might need to make some adjustments
if you are following Programming Rainbow's SDL tutorial. At some point I'll add 
some notes for that, but right now you are 

## How to get it to run

Assuming Mac OS with SDL, SDL Mixer, SDL TTF, SDL image installed in /Library/Frameworks the current procedure to get something running is:

1. cd platforms/unix
2. make clean
3. make all
4. ./pforth_standalone
5. cd ../../SDL_tools
6. 500000 CODE-SIZE !         \ request code portion of new dictionary to be 500000 bytes
7. 300000 HEADERS-SIZE !      \ request name portion of new dictionary to be 300000 bytes
8. c" bigger.dic" SAVE-FORTH  \ create new and bigger dictionary file
9. bye
10. ../platforms/unix/pforth_standalone -dbigger-dic
11.  SDL_GetTicks .         \ should print zero
12.  SDL_GetTicks .         \ should print a bigger number like 935.
13.  SDL_GetTicks .         \ should print a bigger number like 2071.
14.  include sdl2_example.fth   \ you can press space to change the colour of the screen, and escape to exit.

If you are not using MacOS or the framework is in a different place then you'll 
need to adjust the `Makefile`. This will be fixed at some point. You'll also need to adjust the paths of SDL_mixer, SDL_image and SDL_ttf to SDL2/SDL_xxxx.h inside
csrc/sdl2_helper.h before doing the `make all`

Otherwise the instructions are the same. At some point I'll get the second part of the SDL headers included into the pforth_standalone build, and the dictionary expansion won't be required to run the demo.

    * ~~Optional Long name - PR back to pForth~~
* float parameters, float return - allow rest of SDL functions to be used
* Portability: Tidy up make file for Linux, homebrew
* Portability: Fix windows build
* Portability: Statically link SDL2 - in reality, README: because this means people an play your game without extra DLLs, shared libs, or frameworks
* Portability: Fix sdl2_helper.h paths for SDL2 that are mac Library/framework specificâ€¦ (SDL2_Mixer/, etc.)

## LONGER TERM TO DO LIST

* Fix this README properly - instructions of building, and instructions on SDL_tools directory and SDL2_example.fth
* Add instructions for differences between gForth and pForth when using tutorials.
* Add names too long warning to pForth


# ORIGINAL PFORTH TEXT - edit it at some point.

# PForth - a Portable ANS-like Forth written in ANSI 'C'

by Phil Burk
with Larry Polansky, David Rosenboom and Darren Gibbs.
Support for 64-bit cells by Aleksej Saushev.

Portable Forth written in 'C' for most 32 and 64-bit platforms.

PForth is written in 'C' and can be easily ported to new 32 and 64-bit platforms. 
It only needs character input and output functions to operate and, therefore, does not require an operating system.
This makes it handy for bringing up and testing embedded systems.

PForth also works on desktops including Windows, Mac and Linux and supports command line history.
This lets you develop hardware tests on a desktop before trying them on your embedded system.
But pForth is not a rich and friendly desktop programming environment.
There are no GUI tools for developing desktop applications. PForth is lean and mean and optimized for portability.

PForth has a tool for compiling code on a desktop, then exporting the dictionary in big or little endian format as 'C' source code.
This lets you compile tests for an embedded system that does not have file I/O.

PForth is based on ANSI-Forth but is not 100% compatible. https://forth-standard.org/standard/words

Code for pForth is maintained on GitHub at: https://github.com/philburk/pforth

Documentation for pForth at: http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/

## How to Build pForth

Building pForth involves two steps:
1) building the C based Forth kernel
2) building the Forth dictionary file using: ./pforth -i system.fth
3) optional build of standalone executable with built-in dictionary

We have provided build scripts to simplify this process.

On Unix and MacOS using Makefile:

    cd platforms/unix
    make all
    ./pforth_standalone
    
For more details, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/philburk/pforth/wiki/Compiling-on-Unix)

Using CMake:

    cmake .
    make
    cd fth
    ./pforth_standalone

For embedded systems, see the pForth reference manual at:

  http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/pf_ref.php

## How to Run pForth

To run the all-in-one pForth enter:

    ./pforth_standalone
    
OR, to run using the dictionary file, enter:

    ./pforth

Quick check of Forth:

    3 4 + .
    words
    bye

To compile source code files use:

    INCLUDE filename

To create a custom dictionary enter in pForth:

    c" newfilename.dic" SAVE-FORTH
    
The name must end in ".dic".

To run PForth with the new dictionary enter in the shell:

    pforth -dnewfilename.dic

To run PForth and automatically include a forth file:
    pforth myprogram.fth
    
## How to Test pForth

PForth comes with a small test suite.  To test the Core words,
you can use the coretest developed by John Hayes.

On Unix and MacOS using Makefile:

    cd platforms/unix
    make test

Using CMake:

    cmake .
    make
    cd fth
    ./pforth
    include tester.fth
    include coretest.fth

To run the other tests, enter:

    pforth t_corex.fth
    pforth t_strings.fth
    pforth t_locals.fth
    pforth t_alloc.fth

They will report the number of tests that pass or fail.

You can also test pForth kernel without loading a dictionary using option "-i".
Only the primitive words defined in C will be available.
This might be necessary if the dictionary can't be built.

    ./pforth -i
    3 4 + .
    23 77 swap .s
    loadsys
